PI Adapter for MQTT is capable of collecting health and diagnostics information. It supports buffering, unsolicited data collection, automatic discovery of available data items on a SparkplugB data source, various Windows and Linux-based operating systems, and containerization.

This version is released with the support for edge module. It is also available as a module for remote deployment using [Edge Management.](https://edgemanagement.connect.aveva.com/help/#/home/665186/10/11)
